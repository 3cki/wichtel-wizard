# Using Wichteln Wizard

A step-by-step guide to organizing your Secret Santa gift exchange.

## For Group Organizers

### Step 1: Create a Group

1. Go to the Wichteln Wizard homepage
2. Click "Create New Group"
3. Fill in the group details:
   - **Group Name**: e.g., "Smith Family Christmas 2024"
   - **Description** (optional): Add context like budget, theme, etc.
   - **Draw Date** (optional): Set when assignments will be made
4. Click "Create Group"
5. You'll receive a unique 6-character code (e.g., "ABC123")

### Step 2: Share the Code

Share your group code with participants through:
- Text message
- Email
- Social media
- Printed invitations

### Step 3: Monitor Participation

- Check who has joined your group
- See how many wishes each person has added
- Wait until everyone has joined and added their wishlists

### Step 4: Draw Secret Santa

Once everyone is ready:
1. Click the "Draw Secret Santa" button
2. Confirm the action (this cannot be undone!)
3. The system will:
   - Randomly assign each person to give a gift to someone else
   - Ensure no one gets themselves
   - Make assignments visible to all participants

## For Participants

### Step 1: Join a Group

1. Get the group code from your organizer
2. Go to Wichteln Wizard homepage
3. Enter the code in "Join Existing Group"
4. Click "Join Group"
5. You'll be assigned a fun anonymous name (e.g., "Jolly Reindeer")

### Step 2: Add Your Wishlist

1. Once joined, scroll to "My Wishlist"
2. Add gift ideas by filling in:
   - **Gift Idea**: Short title (e.g., "Board Game")
   - **Description**: More details (e.g., "Strategy games, not too complex")
   - **Product Link**: Optional URL to specific item
3. Add multiple wishes (3-5 is ideal)
4. You can delete wishes before the draw

### Step 3: Wait for the Draw

- Check back to see when Secret Santa has been drawn
- You'll be notified by the green "Secret Santa Drawn!" badge

### Step 4: See Your Assignment

After the draw:
1. Return to the group page
2. You'll see a green card showing:
   - Who you're buying for (their anonymous name)
   - Their complete wishlist with descriptions and links
3. Start shopping!

## Anonymous Names

The app automatically generates fun Christmas-themed names like:
- Jolly Reindeer
- Sparkly Snowflake
- Merry Elf
- Cozy Penguin
- Festive Gingerbread

These names keep the exchange fun and anonymous!
